A Twitter like website with database supported

The website could be visited at 
http://cgi-cspp.cs.uchicago.edu/~cheonhyangzhang/cs53001/final/
This website is put on the machine of UChicago, I am not sure when they would remove it from the machine,
since I am graduating this June.
However, it is still working right now(May 21st, 2013). So if you want to have a look at it , just go ahead.


Implementing basic features of Twitter
Including but not limited to sending tweets, comments, following users, searching for
users or tweets


Note: The focus of this project is on the database practice, so the appearance of the website is not so good.
The website would be seen strange on partiuclar size of monitor.
If so, please change zoom in or zoom out to make it look comfortable.
